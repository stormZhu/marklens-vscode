/**
 * Dock tab ids and layout facts — the icon-free half of the dock tab registry.
 *
 * This module deliberately imports NOTHING (no Vue, no lucide) so that it stays
 * safe to pull into composables that tests import with narrow module mocks. In
 * particular `useWideScreenLayout` depends on this file, and that composable is
 * reached from many components (BottomSheet, AppHeader, FileViewer, …) whose
 * tests mock `lucide-vue-next` with only a handful of icons. Importing icon
 * components here would make those tests throw at module load with
 * `No "FolderOpen" export is defined on the "lucide-vue-next" mock`.
 *
 * The icon/title half lives in `dockTabMeta.ts`, which only the dock-rendering
 * code imports.

 * This exists because the dock previously kept the *same fact* in two places
 * that had to be hand-synced: what the dock renders (`overflowTabs` +
 * `wideScreenTabMeta` in App.vue) and what switching accepts
 * (`WIDE_SCREEN_DOCK_TABS` in useWideScreenLayout.ts). Nothing derived one from
 * the other, so adding a tab and forgetting the whitelist produced a button
 * that rendered but silently did nothing on click — exactly what happened to
 * the forge tab.
 *
 * Now the render list, the switch whitelist and the dock order all derive from
 * this array, so that class of divergence cannot recur: adding a tab here makes
 * it renderable *and* switchable at once. (Its icon is added in dockTabMeta.ts.)
 *
 * Order is the dock's display order. Runtime-gated tabs (terminal, proxy) are
 * still declared here; App.vue filters them out when the feature is disabled.
