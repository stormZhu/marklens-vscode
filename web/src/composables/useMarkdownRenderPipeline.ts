/**
 * Shared Markdown → rendered HTML pipeline for FILE PREVIEW context.
 *
 * Both MarkdownPreview.vue (the on-screen file preview) and the HTML exporter
 * (exportMarkdownHtml.ts) render a markdown *file* the same way, so a file
 * exported to standalone HTML looks pixel-identical to the in-app preview.
 *
 * This differs from the chat-render pipeline in `useMarkdownRenderer.ts`:
 * - file previews pass `sanitize: false` (the file is a trusted local artifact)
 * - file previews skip the chat enhancement block (skipEnhancements: true):
 *   no audio/video conversion, no worktree/commit/localhost annotations, no
 *   `chat-img` classes. Local images are rewritten by a caller-supplied
 *   `fixImagePaths` function that resolves relative paths against the markdown
 *   file's own directory (see createFixLocalImagePaths).
 * - file previews then run `annotateFilePaths` with `baseDir = dirName(path)`
 *   (component-level, in the caller) so relative links resolve to the file's dir.
